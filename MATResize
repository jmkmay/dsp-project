function [ new_mat ] = MATResize( old_mat, size )
%MATResize Resizes the vector old_mat to match size
%   Uses a floor technique... could potentially use a linear/quadratic regression to get a more accurate representation
%%How many extra entries do we need to add to old_mat?
extra_entries = size - length(old_mat);
%%How many entries need to be inserted between each matrix element?

%%Insert inserts number of vector elements of same value between each
