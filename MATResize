function [ new_mat ] = MATResize( old_mat, size )
%UNTITLED2 Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here
%%How many extra entries do we need to add to old_mat?
extra_entries = size - length(old_mat);
%%How many entries need to be inserted between each matrix element?
inserts = floor(extra_entries/length(old_mat));

%%Insert inserts number of vector elements of same value between each
%%new_mat

new_mat = zeros(1,size);

for i = 1:length(old_mat)
    for j = 1:inserts
        new_mat(i*inserts + j) = old_mat(i);
    end
end
